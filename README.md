hello [mono-repo](https://monorepo.tools/) world! [[💚]]()

# WELCOME

        This repo is for language learning and also mono repo learning with bazel(google).
        It consists of the languages & content i will be using, both paid and the FREE.
        ** Please note: this will be my learning journey indeed but not 100% of all of it
        for obvious reasons, with the simple reason being its a bit more tedious to document 
        every hint of knowledge that i come across. On the bright side it means there is
        some exploration for you, to do on your own 🫡👍

        ** FROM THE PROPER DEFINITION, THIS ISN'T A MONOREPO YET..JUST A BIG REPO 😅
